# Parametric Tensile Test Specimens (CadQuery)

This repository contains fully parametric tensile test specimen models
implemented in CadQuery. The geometry is fully script-based and allows
automatic generation of ASTM/ISO specimens with customizable internal
patterns such as grid, gyroid, diamond, and honeycomb lattices.

The aim of the project is to provide an open-source and academically usable
pipeline for generating 3D-printable specimens for mechanical testing.

These models are intended for:
- Mechanical testing research and experiments  
- Material behavior comparison under different infill patterns  
- Automated specimen generation for workflows  
- Academic publications and open-source scientific work
